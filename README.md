# EEGCogNet
Welcome to the GitHub Repository of EEGCogNet, a dataset of Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings collected with affordable technology from 120 non-expert subjects while performing frequent and common cognitive activities. 

## Overview
The dataset is the aggregation of the results from four separate experiments: Read-Write-Type (RWT), Think-Count-Recall (TCR), GRE-Relax (GRE), Math-Shut-Read-Open (MSR). The repository provides the general functionality to run the benchmark our four datasets.
